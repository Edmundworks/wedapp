DONT FORGET TO TSC --w when starting!

how to have a picture open in a large version?

make each picture a button
onclick call a box on top? - modal
this box also has a button
onclick of that , close the box

fix the vertical picture on page 3
// can I pass the height in pixels as a variable?
// interesting problem where beckbox remains checked from one page to the next

// checkbox
// on click to go forward or back, need to call a "save checkboxes" fn
// need to reload pages with box checked using the array that fn stores
// submit selected photos to board button
// or just having the checkbox selected "pins" them to the board
